# Create a turtle, and assign it to a variable. When you ask for its type, what do you get?
# This chapter showed us how to sum a list of items, and how to count items. The counting example also had an if
# statement that let us only count some selected items. We have break to exit a loop, and continue to abandon the
# current iteration of the loop without ending the loop.
# Composition of list traversal, summing, counting, testing conditions and early exit is a rich collection of building
# blocks that can be combined in powerful ways to create many functions that are all slightly different.
# The first six questions are typical functions you should be able to write using only these building blocks.

# Solution: see folder3
