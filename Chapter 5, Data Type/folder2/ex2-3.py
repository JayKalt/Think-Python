# EXERCISE 2:
# Is a pair a generalization of a tuple, or is a tuple a generalization of a pair?

# Answer:
# A tuple is a generalization of a pair.

# Reason:
# A pair can be seen as a tuple with two elements, so it's a specific case of a tuple.
# A tuple can have as many elements as we want, also but not only two (as a pair does), so it's a general case of a pair. 



# EXERCISE 3:
# Is a pair a kind of tuple, or is a tuple a kind of pair?

# Answer:
# A pair it's a kind of tuple

# Reason:
# Following the logic of exercise 2, being the pair a specific case of a tuple, it is indeed a tuple.
# So the tuple could be, but not necessarely, composed by two elements, taking the name of "pair" (but just the name).
