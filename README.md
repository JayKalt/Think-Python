# Think-Python-How-to-Think-Like-a-Computer-Scientist
 My personal walkthrough the book Think Python by Peter Wentworth, Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey and Chris Meyers

 There you'll find my solution to most of (maybe all) the exercises proposed by the book, some notes and summaries of the
 book chapters.

 If you have any suggestion please let me know anywhere you want.
 Hope you enjoy and find it helpful!
