# Think-Python-How-to-Think-Like-a-Computer-Scientist
 My personal walkthrough the book Think Python by Peter Wentworth, Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey and Chris Meyers

 There you'll find my solution to most of (maybe all) the exercises proposed by the book, some notes and summaries of the
 book chapters.

 If you have any suggestion please let me know anywhere you want.
 Hope you enjoy and find it helpful!


FILE ORGANIZATION
-----------------------------------
The book is divided into chapters so is my repository.

Each chapter int the book has a teory part and exercises to do.
Each chapter in my repo as well.

Sometimes the exercise's number goes back to 1 for some reason (maybe the topic of the exercise change).
So I decided to create a new folder each time this happens.

For example in Chapter 3 you have exercises from 1 to 10, then from 1 to 12, an then from 1 to 14 or something like that.
So for the first 10 exercises I created a folder1, for the second a folder2 an so on...

The repo would be like this:
Book
├── folder1
│   ├── exercises
|   |   ├── exercises1
|   |   |   ├── exercise1.py
|   |   |   ├── exercise2.py
│   |   |   └── exercise...
|   |   └── exercises2
|   |       ├── exercise1.py
|   |       ├── exercise2.py
│   |       └── exercise...
|   └── summary.txt
|
