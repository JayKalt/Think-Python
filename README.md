# Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist

Welcome to my personal walkthrough of the book **Think Python** by Peter Wentworth, Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, and Chris Meyers. In this repository, you will find my solutions to most (if not all) of the exercises proposed in the book, along with notes and summaries of each chapter.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by chapters, mirroring the structure of the book. Each chapter contains both theoretical content and exercises to complete. 

### Folder Organization

- Each chapter is represented by a folder.
- Exercises are grouped into subfolders. If the exercise numbering resets (e.g., from 1 to 10, then 1 to 12), a new folder is created for each set of exercises.

#### Example Structure

Here’s an example of how the folder structure looks:

```plaintext
Book/
├── Chapter1/
│   ├── folder1/
│   │   ├── ex1.py
│   │   ├── ex2.py
│   │   └── etc...
│   └── folder2/
│       ├── ex1.py
│       ├── ex2.py
│       └── etc...
├── Chapter2/
├── Chapter3/
.
.
└── Summaries/
    ├── summary_chapter1.txt
    ├── summary_chapter2.txt
    └── etc...
```

### Contents

- **Chapter/**: Folder that contains the exercises of that chapter
- **folder/**: Contains the exercises on specific topics of that chapter
- **ex.py**: The Python exercises solved

- **Summaries/**: The folder that contains all the summaries of the book
- **summary.txt**: A summary of the chapter's key concepts and notes
