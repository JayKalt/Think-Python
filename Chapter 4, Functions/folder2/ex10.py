# Which of these tests fail? Explain why.

# 3 % 4 == 0			---> False: 3 % 4 == 3 because the quotient is 0 an the remainder 3
# 3 % 4 == 3			---> True: see below
# 3 / 4 == 0			---> Flase: 3 / 4 has a float quotient
# 3 // 4 == 0			---> True: the integer quotient is 0
# 3+4 * 2 == 14			---> Flase: it's 3 + (4 * 2) == 11
# 4-2+2 == 0			---> False: 4 - 2 + 2 = 2
# len("hello, world!") == 13	---> True: there are 13 char in the string
