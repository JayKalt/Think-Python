Functions are used to organize program into chunks that match
how we think about the problem.

In order to use them we have to call them.

Syntax:

	def <NAME>( <PARAMETERS>):
		<STATEMENTS>


Example:

	def draw_square(animal, size):
		"""
		Make animal draw a square with sides of length size.	<--- dockstring
		"""
			for _ in range(4):
				animal.forward(size)
				animal.left(90)



Dockstrings are the key way to document our functions in Python.
We are not supposed how they exaclty work. We want to know the arguments
and what, what is does and the expected result.

Dockstrings are usually formed using triple-quoted strings


Functions can call other functions. They are called nested function (?)


Some function in this chapter:

	abs()
	pow()
	max()
	range()

There are 2 types of functions:

	1. Fruitful functions: return a value
	2. Void functions: do not return anything, usually known as procedure


Variables created in the function scope are local variables.
That means when the function ends, the variable won't be accessible no more
We can call it also lifetime of a variable.
If we want a variable to still exist when the function is done, we can declare
it as global within the function.

For example:
sz = 2
def h2():
	global sz
	sz += 1




By rearranging a code previously written we say refactoring the code.

Code that appears after a return statement, or any other place the flow of
execution can never reach, is called dead code or unreachable code.
So, always make sure every possible path through the program hits a return
statement.



INCREMENTAL DEVELOPMENT:
The goal is to avoid long debugging sessions by adding and testing only a small
amount of code at time.

To debug, an easy an practical way is by using print to see stored value into
variables. Remember to always learn a real debugger if it's needed.


WARNING ABOUT FUNCTIONS:
An important think about function is: do not program CHATTERBOX functions
A chatterbox function is a functions that asks for an input or prints output.


COMPOSITION:
As we said, we can call a function from within another. This is called composition


TO FOLLOW A GOOD STANDARD:
Python Enhancement Proposal 8 (PEP 8), http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/



TYPES OF FUNCTION: MODIFIERS VS PURE FUNCTIONS
Modifiers take list as arguments an change them during execution. They're called so
because they produce side effects.
A pure function instead, does not produce side effects, it just returns a value.

For example a function double_stuff(list) can be:
A PURE FUNCTION:
list = [2, 4, 6]
new_list = double_stuff(list)
new_list = [4, 8, 12]
list = [2, 4, 6]

A MODIFIER:
list = [2, 4, 6]
list = double_stuff(list)
list = [4, 8, 12]

Generally speaking, modifiers are more risky then a pure function, so always think
about using them and the risks you could face.




STRINGS
Four fundamental operator to work with strings:
. len(str) finds the lenght of a string (already saw that)
. str[i] the subscript operation extracts the i'th char of the string, as a new string
. str[i:j] the slice operation extracts a subtring out of a string
. str.find(target) returns the index where target ossurs within the string, or -1 if it's not found
