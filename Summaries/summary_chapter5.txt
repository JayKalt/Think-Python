STRINGS:

USEFUL METHODS:
------
. string.upper()  >  changes all string char from lower to upper
. string.lower()  >  same as lower but viceversa
. string.capitalize()  >  capitalize the first letter
. string.swapcase()  >  revert the case of each char
. string.split()  >  splits a string of multi words into a single words list removing whitespace
------
. enumaerate(list)  > associates each element to its index
------


NEGATIVE INDEX:
We can work with negative index that starts from the end of the word
and goes up to the first.
E.G:
  world = "Test"

word[-1] = t
You can use it for index of any list.


COMPARE STRINGS:
We can compare strings. The only thing to really remember is that
upper case letteres come first then lowercase letters. That's all.


STRINGS ARE IMMUTABLE!!!!!


OPTIONAL PARAMETERS:
Optional parameters are assigned if they find a match between the call
and the arguments.
If they don't, it will assign a default vaule specificed in the def.
E.G:
  def find(haystack, needle, start=0):
    ....
In this case, if the call finds a match to the start parameter it will
assign the value, else start will be zero.
