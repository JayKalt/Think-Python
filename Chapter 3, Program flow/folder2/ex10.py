# Write a program to draw a shape like this (a star):

#	 Hints:

#	• Try this on a piece of paper, moving and turning your cellphone as if it was a turtle. Watch how many
#	complete rotations your cellphone makes before you complete the star. Since each full rotation is 360
#	degrees, you can figure out the total number of degrees that your phone was rotated through. If you divide
#	that by 5, because there are five points to the star, you’ll know how many degrees to turn the turtle at each
#	point.

#	• You can hide a turtle behind its invisibility cloak if you don’t want it shown. It will still draw its lines if
#	its pen is down. The method is invoked as tess.hideturtle() . To make the turtle visible again, use
#	tess.showturtle()

import turtle

window = turtle.Screen()
tess = turtle.Turtle()
tess.pensize(5)
tess.hideturtle()

for i in range(5):
	tess.forward(200)
	tess.right(144)

window.mainloop()
